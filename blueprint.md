## Overview

## Project Outline

### **1. Visual Design & Style**

*   **Palette:**
    *   Text: Almost black (`#222`)
    *   Background: White (`#fff`)
    *   Links: A standard web blue (`#007bff`).
    *   Article Link Color: Orange (`#FF7F24`)
    *   Logo Color 1 (Zach): `#FF0084`
    *   Logo Color 2 (Holman!): `#FF7F24`
    *   Footer Gradient Start: `#ff0084`
    *   Footer Gradient End: `#ffc400`
*   **Typography:**
    *   A clean, modern sans-serif font (`-apple-system`, `BlinkMacSystemFont`, etc.).
*   **Layout:**
    *   Single column with a `max-width` for readability.
    *   Grid-based layout for article listings.

### **2. Features & Interactivity**

*   **Header & Footer:** Consistent across all pages.
*   **About Page:** The initial landing page with biographical information.
*   **Writing Page:** A section listing all articles, grouped by year.
*   **Responsive Navigation:** A hamburger menu on smaller screens.

## Completed Tasks

1.  **Initial Scaffolding & About Page:** Created the main HTML, CSS, and JS files. Implemented the "About" page, including layout, styling, and responsive design.
2.  **Mobile Navigation:** Implemented the hamburger menu and the JavaScript-powered toggle for the mobile navigation overlay.
3.  **Final Polish:** Refined the logo styling and added final touches to the "About" page.

## Current Plan: "Writing" Section

1.  **Create `writing.html`:** Create a new HTML file for the "Writing" section, reusing the header and footer from the main page.
2.  **Add Content:** Populate `writing.html` with the title, introductory paragraph, and a grid of articles grouped by year, based on the provided design.
3.  **Update `style.css`:** Add new styles for the article grid, cards, and typography specific to the writing section.
4.  **Update Navigation:** Modify the header in all HTML files to correctly link to the new `writing.html` page.

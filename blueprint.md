# Blueprint: Zach Holman's Personal Website Replica

## Overview

This document outlines the plan and implementation details for creating a pixel-perfect, responsive replica of Zach Holman's personal website. The project will be built using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, adhering to modern web standards and best practices.

## Project Outline

### **1. Visual Design & Style**

*   **Palette:**
    *   Text: Almost black (`#222`)
    *   Background: White (`#fff`)
    *   Links: A standard web blue (`#007bff`).
    *   Article Link Color: Orange (`#FF7F24`)
    *   Logo Color 1 (Zach): `#FF0084`
    *   Logo Color 2 (Holman!): `#FF7F24`
    *   Footer Gradient Start: `#ff0084`
    *   Footer Gradient End: `#ffc400`
*   **Typography:**
    *   A clean, modern sans-serif font (`-apple-system`, `BlinkMacSystemFont`, etc.).
*   **Layout:**
    *   Single column with a `max-width` for readability.
    *   Grid-based layout for article listings.

### **2. Features & Interactivity**

*   **Header & Footer:** Consistent across all pages.
*   **Navigation:** Main navigation includes About, Writing, Experience, and Resume.
*   **About Page:** The initial landing page with biographical information.
*   **Writing Page:** A section listing all articles, grouped by year.
*   **Responsive Navigation:** A hamburger menu on smaller screens.

## Completed Tasks

1.  **Initial Scaffolding & About Page:** Created the main HTML, CSS, and JS files. Implemented the "About" page, including layout, styling, and responsive design.
2.  **Mobile Navigation:** Implemented the hamburger menu and the JavaScript-powered toggle for the mobile navigation overlay.
3.  **"Writing" Section:** Created the `writing.html` page with a styled grid of articles.

## Current Plan: Update Navigation

1.  **Modify Navigation Bar:** Remove the "Investing" and "Speaking" links from the header navigation.
2.  **Add New Links:** Add new links for "Experience" and "Resume" to the header navigation in their place.
3.  **Apply to All Pages:** Ensure the updated navigation is consistent across all existing HTML files (`index.html` and `writing.html`).
